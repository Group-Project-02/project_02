# Memory Phone
Group Project #2

Memory Phone is a game like the game of telephone. A few sentences will pop up, and you will have a set amount of time to read them and memorize them as best as possible. Then you will have to type out the sentences from memory. Each game goes 5 rounds, and each consecutive person plays off the previous person.
